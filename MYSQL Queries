-- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on ''2023-04-25''
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales_dataset
WHERE Sales_date='2023-04-25';


-- Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of april-2023
SELECT * FROM retail_sales_dataset
WHERE Product_Category='clothing'
AND Sales_date BETWEEN '2023-4-1' AND '2023-4-30' 
AND Quantity >=4;

-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
SELECT Product_Category ,sum(Total_Amount) as Total_Sales,count(*) as Total_orders
FROM retail_sales_dataset
GROUP BY Product_Category;

-- Q.4Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
SELECT 
round(AVG(AGE),0)
from retail_sales_dataset
WHERE Product_Category='Beauty';

-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales_dataset
WHERE Total_Amount >1000;

-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
SELECT
Product_Category,Gender,count(Transaction_ID)
FROM retail_sales_dataset
GROUP BY Gender ,Product_Category
ORDER BY Product_Category;

-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
SELECT 
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sales_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sales_date) as month,
    AVG(Total_amount) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sales_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_Amount) DESC) as ranks
FROM retail_sales_dataset
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE ranks = 1;


-- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
SELECT 
customer_id,
sum(Total_amount) as Total_Sales
FROM retail_sales_dataset
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;

SELECT
Product_category,
count(distinct customer_id) as cnt_unique_customer
FROM retail_sales_dataset
